Big Things:

	Unhandled Rejection (SyntaxError): Unexpected end of JSON input

	Doesnt work: added classes -- use section table
		charts

	Need to:
		Fix getting the data and processing data to show in CourseDetailPane
		 -> Data can be recieved
		 -> Does not get new data Format
		 -> currently crashes with search

		make graphs work with new data model


Small things:
	efficiency


Everything in left pane works
Right pane does not work


AddedCoursesPane Remarks:
	- Does not currently seperate by school
	- Got data from appstore, so if we can add the school to the appstore,
			would be able to add school
	- Reformats by adding a 'sections', if possible rename "section" to "sections"
			when storing added courses
